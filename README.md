# Playwright Scenario Demonstrations
The goal of this project is to demonstrate handling various scenarios in Playwright while following best practices.

The websites under test are a handful of testing websites whose purpose is for QA engineers to upskill and/or add to their portfolios.

I am sourcing them from [this github repo](https://github.com/BMayhew/awesome-sites-to-test-on).

Currently, I've implemented testing for some scenarios from https://commitquality.com/practice.

To-Do:
-
* Complete Commit Quality
* Choose and automate a handful of website pages that simulate real-world scenarios (i.e. banking website)
* Implement a reporter
* Look into mobile
